      <p>
        I know you‚Äôre probably not expecting a message like this from me, especially since wala tayong interactions aside sa ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù HAHAHAHA.<br><br>
        To be direct and honest, my interest in you has grown over the past few days. At first, I was in denial akala ko gutom lang 'to e, totoo pala and as time went on, it only grew bigger. Maybe I'll share the full story sometime if you‚Äôre open to it, it's a bit long, but it might help explain how it all started.<br><br>
        I‚Äôm saying this because I‚Äôve been carrying it for a while, and I feel like it‚Äôs been holding me back. I‚Äôm not expecting anything in return, but if you‚Äôre open to getting to know each other, I‚Äôd be really grateful for that opportunity.<br><br>
        That‚Äôs all I wanted to say for now. Don‚Äôt worry, take all the time you need to respond. I just hope this message doesn‚Äôt make you feel pressured in any way.
